# Restaurant-project
restaurant website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves building a simple yet appealing interface to showcase the restaurant's offerings.

HTML: Create the basic structure with elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, and <footer>.
Include sections for the menu, about the restaurant, contact information, and location.

CSS: Style the website with a modern design. Use colors that reflect the restaurant's theme.
Apply responsive design principles to ensure it looks good on all devices.

JavaScript: Add interactivity, such as a dynamic menu that can be filtered by category or a contact form that validates user input.
Implement features like a slideshow for images of dishes or a reservation form that confirms user submissions.
